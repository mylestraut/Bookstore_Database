# Bookstore_Database
A bookstore database application with CRUD functionality using MySQL and a GUI built using Java Swing.

This is my first attempt at a database application that has a GUI and is built using the MVC design pattern.

Currently the application only has a search by ID function, but other search functionality will be added in the near future.

DATABASE LAYOUT

Create a MySQL database that that contains a table with the following values:

id: int,
title: varchar(50),
author: varchar(50),
qty: int;
